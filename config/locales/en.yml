        slug: |
          The slug will be the handle used in either the url or to retrieve
          the entry. The "default" value is used when the slug doesn't matter
          and you have just one entry of that type.

    hints:
      new_entry_type: |
        Use an entry-type to group content that shares the same structure.
        For example a list of editorials that all have a title and a body should
        belong to a single entry-type named "editorial".
